Layman's Plan:

1. Get User's note-string from text-box
2. a. Initialise a note object; & insert note-string
    2 b. add 1 to note-counter, & label new note with resulting #
3. Insert note object into browser's HTML
4. When 'View Detail' is clicked on a note, modal pops up:
    - displays entire note text
    - modal is scrollable without page itself scrolling behind it
    - modal has 'Close' btn
